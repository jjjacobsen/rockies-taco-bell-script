these are just general notes on my process building this script
-first "pip install beautifulsoup4" and "pip install requests"
-some basic github commands since I keep forgetting so I should remember:
	-git clone <url> (create local repository)
	-git status (see what is different from local and remote repositories)
	-gid add <file> (stage selected file for commit, use -A flag to add everything)
	-git commit -m "message" (commit staged files to remote repository)
	-git branch (shows all local branches, * is current branch)
	-git checkout <branch name> (switch to different branch)
	-git checkout -b <new branch name> (create a new branch and move to it)
	-git push origin <branch name> (origin is remote repository url, run after commit to update remote repository)
	-git pull origin <branch name> (grab's whatever is on remote repository and updates local branch)
	-git log (shows log of recent commits)
-im gonna use this site to pull from: http://www.espn.com/mlb/team/schedule/_/name/col
-dont think running this script on a work server is gonna fly, need to host somewhere else
-add Alec's email if he wants
